# python-type-speed-test

This project was my submission for Day 85 the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

> The app displays a list of words (3000 most commonly used English words), highlights the current word, space or return checks the accuracy of the typed word and then colors the text in green or red on correct or incorrect words.  Words per minute are shown continuously each time the user presses enter or space to complete the current highlighted word.  Reset button resets and shuffles the words list and resets the timer.

> The biggest challenge was learning about all the methods for highlighting and manipulating text in TKinter.

> If I were to do this project again I would make it a flat function based app rather than object oriented method based.  OOP wasn't particularly useful for this project.
